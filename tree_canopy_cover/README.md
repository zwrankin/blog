## Data 
- Raw data Downloaded as per `download_conus_2016.sh` from https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/rastergateway/treecanopycover/index.php
- There are additioanlly some files (e.g. lower resolution shapefiles) that were processed by a script and can be found (with additional documentation) here: https://www.kaggle.com/zwrankin/usfs-tree-canopy-cover. This was largely to accomodate Kaggle Datasets 20GB limit. 
- TODO - add scripts that manipulated the data
